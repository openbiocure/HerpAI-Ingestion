Initial project structure for HerpAI-Ingestion

This commit establishes the foundation for the HerpAI-Ingestion project, a biomedical data ingestion library that extends HerpAI-Lib. The structure follows proper software engineering practices and extends the existing functionality of HerpAI-Lib rather than duplicating it.

Key components added:
- Biomedical-specific entity models (Document, IngestionState, ScheduledJob)
- Repository interfaces with domain-specific methods
- Specifications for common biomedical data queries
- Source connector architecture for different biomedical data sources
- CLI command structure for user interaction
- BiomedicalAppConfig extending HerpAI-Lib's AppConfig

This implementation properly leverages existing HerpAI-Lib functionality:
- Uses the engine for dependency injection
- Extends the BaseEntity for domain models
- Uses IRepository for base CRUD operations
- Uses the Specification pattern for queries
- Follows the AppConfig pattern for configuration

Technical highlights:
- Clean separation of interfaces and implementations
- Type annotations and protocol-based interfaces
- Domain-specific models for biomedical data
- CLI powered by Typer with rich console output

Next steps will involve implementing the source connectors, storage services, and processing functionality.
